# ProgrammingExamCurriculum
 My all-in-one exam prep solution, containing projects for my entire programming curriculum.
 
 I created this project while preparing for my programming exam on my third semester of studying computer science.
 It contains severeral self-contained projects, each of which aims to demonstrate a core programming principle or topic.
 
 These projects are written to be easy to talk about during an examination, and cover topics such as algorithms, graphs, threading, design patterns testing, and more.
